There's more then on RS-485 serial output format for the Young Wind Tracker 06201.  For the older models:

24 bytes

byte   Description                                         Value
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0      Header, always                                             36
 1      Max/Dir Display, code for right numeric display             0 = max speed, 1=direction
 2      Sensor/WS Units. Code for sensor type and units displayed  12 = Wind monitor with knots
 3      Binary code for 8 annunciator lights on front panel        64 = knots
 4      Audio Beeper On/Off                                         0 = off, 1 = on
 5      Direction Alarm                                             0 = off, 1 = on
 6      Speed Alarm                                                 0 = off, 1 = on
 7-8    Speed Display - current wind speed displayed                2-byte integer
 9-10   Right Display, Max wind speed or direction                  2-byte integer
11-12   Raw wind speed                                              2-byte integer
13-14   Wind Direction in degrees                                   2-byte integer
15-23   Binary codes for state of direction display LEDs


Newer models use this format:
9 bytes followed by CR/LF.  Byte are ASCII text value, so you need to convert to numbers. 
Format is: 
sss.s ddd<CR/LF>

S is wind speed in meters/second
d is wind direction in degrees

For example:

00 48 51 46 56 32 51 52 52 13 10 
converts to:
03.8 344
3.8 meters/sec
344 degrees
